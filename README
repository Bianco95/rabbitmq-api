    3 - you can do the first two steps using docker compose (whose file is provided in this repo)
        docker-compose up --build -d
    4 - open a terminal, go to the project folder and type "npm run start-master -- set": 
        every second a message of type "set" will be inserted into a rabbitmq queue; 
        stop when you want by pressing ctrl-c

        every two seconds, the worker will take the message from the rabbitmq queue and will push key and the value of the
        message to redis.
